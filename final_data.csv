Feliz dia a todas as mães, que fazem de cada refeição um momento mais mágico. 

#PraTodosVerem​: Vemos uma mãe confiante sentada no banco de motorista do seu carro; em seguida, vemos outra mãe, lendo um livro sentada numa rede; agora, vemos outra, sentada no chão do banheiro, com uma banheira cheia de espuma atrás; e outra, médica, de uniforme, na frente de um hospital. Corta para uma sequência de fotos e vídeos dessas mesmas mães brincando com seus filhos. Primeiro na banheira de espuma, depois se abraçando na cozinha, brincando na rede, compartilhando uma pizza no carro. Agora vemos a família de uma das mães compartilhando tacos na frente da tv. A mãe que estava lendo, comendo pudim com a filha na rede. A mãe médica pedindo um risoto por delivery, chegando em casa e dando um superabraço nos filhos. Vemos uma cena de almoço em família, com uma Coca-Cola à mesa, e desta vez é o pai quem chega trazendo a comida. Vemos a mãe dando um gole de Coca-Cola e uma sequência de fotos que mostra a garrafa caindo.

After flying to an altitude of 39,045 meters (128,100 feet) in a helium-filled balloon, Felix Baumgartner completed a record breaking jump for the ages from the edge of space, exactly 65 years after Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier flying in an experimental rocket-powered airplane. Felix reached a maximum of speed of 1,357.6 km/h or 843.6 mph(Mach 1.25) through the near vacuum of the stratosphere before being slowed by the atmosphere later during his 4:20 minute long freefall. The 43-year-old Austrian skydiving expert also broke two other world records (highest freefall, highest manned balloon flight), leaving the one for the longest freefall to project mentor Col. Joe Kittinger.

ABOUT AIRBNB
Airbnb was born in 2008 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to millions of Hosts who have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, our Hosts offer one-of-a-kind stays and unique experiences that make it possible for guests to experience the world in a more unique, authentic, connected way.

ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN
When you’re going on a trip, why choose to be cramped in a hotel room, when you could get an Airbnb with a private pool, or a room for everyone? Made in collaboration with Buck animation, these films show the many moments that booking an Airbnb makes more sense than booking a hotel.

Airbnb is asking everyone on our platform to accept our community commitment. 

Which means discrimination on the part of any individual won’t be tolerated.

ABOUT AIRBNB
Airbnb was born in 2008 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to millions of Hosts who have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, our Hosts offer one-of-a-kind stays and unique experiences that make it possible for guests to experience the world in a more unique, authentic, connected way.

ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN
When you’re going on a trip, why choose to be cramped in a hotel room, when you could get an Airbnb with a private pool, or a room for everyone? Made in collaboration with Buck animation, these films show the many moments that booking an Airbnb makes more sense than booking a hotel.

They spent one week surrounded by the open sea, living out their own island adventure. They swam. They kayaked. They saw a pod of dolphins and contemplated leaving civilization behind for good.

ABOUT AIRBNB
Airbnb was born in 2008 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to millions of Hosts who have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, our Hosts offer one-of-a-kind stays and unique Experiences that make it possible for guests to experience the world in a more unique, authentic, connected way.

ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN
We invited photographers to take trips on Airbnb with their family and friends, shoot photos of their stays, and send them back to us. They chose homes from across a range of our new categories, from castles, to homes with amazing pools, to the Arctic. We edited the photos together with familiar songs and the result captures the unique experience of traveling on Airbnb, made possible by these new categories. See them all here:

ABOUT AIRBNB
Airbnb was born in 2008 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to millions of Hosts who have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, our Hosts offer one-of-a-kind stays and unique experiences that make it possible for guests to experience the world in a more unique, authentic, connected way.

ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN
We invited photographers to spend a few nights in Airbnb rooms with their family and friends, shoot photos of their stays, and send them back to us. We then interviewed the guests, edited the photos together with iconic songs and the result captures the unique experience of traveling on Airbnb, made possible by these amazing rooms.

ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN: 
If you have a home you’re not always in, or an empty bedroom, or a camper you never use, or a guest house that you only sometimes use, then you have an Airbnb. Lots of people have spaces like these, they just don’t think of them as Airbnbs.

ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN: 
If you have a home you’re not always in, or an empty bedroom, or a camper you never use, or a guest house that you only sometimes use, then you have an Airbnb. Lots of people have spaces like these, they just don’t think of them as Airbnbs.

A casa em meio à floresta em Teresópolis, no Rio de Janeiro, foi o lugar perfeito para desconectar da vida de mãe, profissional e estudante. Tudo começou com uma recepção calorosa, com um bolo feito e presenteado pela anfitriã. Depois, a vida girou em torno da piscina. Foi ali que elas nadaram, relaxaram, tomaram sol e comeram. Entre animais silvestres e uma paisagem inspiradora, as amigas viveram momentos livres de preocupação, rindo, falando besteira ou tendo conversas profundas em volta da fogueira. Foram só dois dias. Mas foi o suficiente para renovar as energias e as amizades. A única preocupação agora é saber quando elas vão poder voltar.

SOBRE O AIRBNB
O Airbnb nasceu em 2007, quando dois anfitriões receberam três hóspedes em sua casa em São Francisco. Hoje, a plataforma conta com 4 milhões de anfitriões que já receberam mais de 1,5 bilhão de hóspedes em quase todos os países do mundo. Todos os dias, os anfitriões oferecem acomodações e experiências únicas que possibilitam que os viajantes conheçam outras comunidades de uma forma mais autêntica.

SOBRE A CAMPANHA
Convidamos fotógrafos para se hospedarem com suas famílias e amigos através do Airbnb, registrarem suas experiências e compartilharem as imagens conosco. Eles escolheram as acomodações dentre as várias opções oferecidas pelas nossas categorias, de castelos a casas com piscinas incríveis até chalés no Ártico. Em seguida, editamos as fotos com músicas conhecidas e o resultado revela a experiência única que é viajar com o Airbnb, tendo nossas categorias como ponto de partida.

ABOUT AIRBNB
Airbnb was born in 2008 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to millions of Hosts who have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, our Hosts offer one-of-a-kind stays and unique experiences that make it possible for guests to experience the world in a more unique, authentic, connected way.

ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN
When you’re going on a trip, why choose to be cramped in a hotel room, when you could get an Airbnb with a private pool, or a room for everyone? Made in collaboration with Buck animation, these films show the many moments that booking an Airbnb makes more sense than booking a hotel.

“At Sony, we take an expansive view on who is a creator. It’s artists of all kinds: animators, graphic artists, filmmakers, musicians, game developers. And it’s innovators, designers, entrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists, because they also create the future. We are all creators. A creator is anybody who challenges the status quo to create something new.” 

Hiroaki Kitano, chief technology officer of Sony Group Corporation, has spent his career at the intersection of technology and creativity. At the inaugural #SonyCreatorsConference, his keynote revealed the possibilities and powerful new forms of expression that can be created when they come together. 

There are 2 more highlight videos introducing “Animation and Music” elements and “Gaming and Film” as well! Don’t miss them!

His job is to design and test the custom packaging solutions used to ship silicon wafers all over the world. In order to learn which solutions work, Ryan has got to push expensive wafers potentially containing thousands of processors to their breaking points. 
 
The packaging used to ship wafers is called a Front-Opening Shipping Box, or FOSB. Each of these specially-designed boxes contain 25 glass-like, silicon wafers totaling $250,000 to multi-million US dollars per box depending on product. Each wafer is incredibly fragile, and it's Ryan's job to insure that each FOSB makes it to its destination with all wafers intact. 
 
Check out Ryan's story, and stay tuned for more stories ""Inside the Fab"" at Intel.

As Dave puts it, it's like ""Looking in a million haystacks for a single needle"". 
 
As silicon wafer production moves smaller and smaller, from 22 nanometer to 14 nanometer, imperfections in production are tough to see even with high-powered microscopes. Dave and his team of fellow scientists are charged with identifying the causes of these nearly invisible defects. 
 
Check out Dave's story, and stay tuned for more stories ""Inside the Fab"" at Intel.

Adapted from the beloved literary classic, THE CALL OF THE WILD vividly brings to the screen the story of Buck, a big-hearted dog whose blissful domestic life is turned upside down when he is suddenly uprooted from his California home and transplanted to the exotic wilds of the Yukon during the Gold Rush of the 1890s. As the newest rookie on a mail delivery dog sled team--and later its leader--Buck experiences the adventure of a lifetime, ultimately finding his true place in the world and becoming his own master.

As a live-action/animation hybrid, THE CALL OF THE WILD employs cutting edge visual effects and animation technology in order to render the animals in the film as fully photorealistic--and emotionally authentic--characters.

Disney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.

“The Little Mermaid,” visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall’s live-action reimagining of the studio’s Oscar®-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. “The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. 

The film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton,” “Snowpiercer”) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca,” “Room”) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.      

“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton,” “In the Heights”), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”), who won two Oscars® for the music in the animated version of “The Little Mermaid,” with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (“Mary Poppins Returns,” “Into the Woods”). Music is by Alan Menken, lyrics are by Howard Ashman and new lyrics are by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

Part Two of the three-part Original Docuseries is now streaming on @DisneyPlus.

The Disney+ original docuseries, directed by Peter Jackson, will be arriving on Disney+ just in time for the Thanksgiving holiday. Made entirely from never-before-seen, restored footage, it provides the most intimate and honest glimpse into the creative process and relationship between John, Paul, George, and Ringo ever filmed.  Be sure to check them both out, and don’t forget to watch “The Beatles: Get Back” when it rolls out over three days, November 25, 26, and 27, 2021, exclusively on Disney+.

Directed by three-time Oscar®-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson (“The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, “They Shall Not Grow Old”), “The Beatles: Get Back” takes audiences back in time to the band’s January 1969 recording sessions, which became a pivotal moment in music history. The docuseries showcases The Beatles’ creative process as they attempt to write 14 new songs in preparation for their first live concert in over two years. Faced with a nearly impossible deadline, the strong bonds of friendship shared by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr are put to the test. The docuseries is compiled from nearly 60 hours of unseen footage shot over 21 days, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg in 1969, and from more than 150 hours of unheard audio, most of which has been locked in a vault for over half a century. Jackson is the only person in 50 years to have been given access to this Beatles treasure trove, all of which has now been brilliantly restored.  What emerges is an unbelievably intimate portrait of The Beatles, showing how, with their backs against the wall, they could still rely on their friendship, good humor, and creative genius. While plans derail and relationships are put to the test, some of the world’s most iconic songs are composed and performed. The docuseries features – for the first time in its entirety – The Beatles’ last live performance as a group, the unforgettable rooftop concert on London’s Savile Row, as well as other songs and classic compositions featured on the band’s final two albums, Abbey Road and Let It Be.

An exciting new collaboration between The Beatles and Jackson presented by The Walt Disney Studios in association with Apple Corps Ltd. and WingNut Films Productions Ltd., “The Beatles: Get Back” is directed by Peter Jackson, produced by Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono Lennon, Olivia Harrison, Peter Jackson, Clare Olssen (“They Shall Not Grow Old”) and Jonathan Clyde (“Eight Days a Week”), with Apple Corps’ Jeff Jones (“Eight Days a Week”) and Ken Kamins (“The Hobbit” trilogy) serving as executive producers. Jabez Olssen (“Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”) serves as the film’s editor, the music supervisor is Giles Martin (“Rocketman”), Michael Hedges (“The Adventures of Tintin”) and Brent Burge (“The Hobbit” trilogy) serve as the series re-recording mixers, and the music is mixed by Giles Martin and Sam Okell (“Yesterday”).

Disney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.

“The Little Mermaid,” visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall’s live-action reimagining of the studio’s Oscar®-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. “The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. 

The film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton,” “Snowpiercer”) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca,” “Room”) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.      

“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton,” “In the Heights”), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”), who won two Oscars® for the music in the animated version of “The Little Mermaid,” with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (“Mary Poppins Returns,” “Into the Woods”). Music is by Alan Menken, lyrics are by Howard Ashman and new lyrics are by Lin-Manuel Miranda.",2022-09-09T23:42:33Z,,30273356,1275818.0,0,84,4.954722749590835,0.0421432628744563,0.0,23,1.369892272112716,0.0127855494634275,,0.0011443553230517,360p,True,0.061146788699036045,0.4228887234652291,0.0,0.17839933848894582,1.1539886254800558

Academy Award® winner Emma Stone (“La La Land”) stars in Disney’s “Cruella,” an all-new live-action feature film about the rebellious early days of one of cinemas most notorious – and notoriously fashionable – villains, the legendary Cruella de Vil. “Cruella,” which is set in 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution, follows a young grifter named Estella, a clever and creative girl determined to make a name for herself with her designs. She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estella’s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by two-time Oscar® winner Emma Thompson (“Howards End,” “Sense & Sensibility”). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.
 
Disney’s “Cruella” is directed by Craig Gillespie (“I Tonya”) from a screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, story by Aline Brosh McKenna and Kelly Marcel & Steve Zissis. It was produced by Andrew Gunn (“Freaky Friday”), Marc Platt (“Mary Poppins Returns”) and Kristin Burr (“Christopher Robin”), with Emma Stone, Michelle Wright, Jared LeBoff and Glenn Close serving as executive producers. Two-time Oscar®- winning costume designer Jenny Beavan (“Mad Max: Fury Road,” “A Room with a View”) creates the dazzling and imaginative costumes, which take on a life of their own.
